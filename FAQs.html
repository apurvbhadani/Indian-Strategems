        <div class="text">
            <h3>1. How does Indian Strategems work?</h3>
            <p>Indian Strategems is a platform that uses user-provided data to recommend relevant government schemes. Users
                need to fill out a questionnaire containing information such as age, hobbies, domain, and education. Based
                on this data, the platform analyzes and matches the user's profile with suitable government schemes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Are the recommended schemes guaranteed?</h3>
            <p>No, the recommendations provided by Indian Strategems are based on the information provided by the user. The
                platform strives to provide accurate and relevant recommendations, but the final eligibility and selection
                for government schemes are determined by the respective government authorities. Users are advised to verify
                the information and eligibility criteria from official government sources.</p> <br>
            <h3>3. Can I apply for schemes directly through Indian Strategems?</h3>
            <p>No, Indian Strategems is an information platform and does not facilitate the application process for
                government schemes. Users need to follow the application procedures specified by the respective government
                authorities or visit their official websites for applying to the schemes.</p> <br>
            <h3>4. Is Indian Strategems affiliated with the government?</h3>
            <p>No, Indian Strategems is an independent platform and is not affiliated with the government. The platform
                provides information about government schemes for the convenience of users.</p> <br>
            <h3>5. Is the information on Indian Strategems up to date?</h3>
            <p>Indian Strategems strives to keep the information up to date; however, government schemes and their
                eligibility criteria may change over time. Users are encouraged to verify the information and eligibility
                criteria from official government sources to ensure accuracy.</p> <br>
